Conclusion For medical diagnosis, especially imbalanced dataset such as this dataset I am working with, accuracy is not always the best metric to determine the performance of a model. However, we need to give priority to precision, F1-score and recall as well as the confusion matrix. The true positive rate and the true negative rate can tell us more about the performance of the model. For this problem, recall is ratio of successfully detected pneumonia observations over all pneumonia observations.  Shortly, false negatives have bigger cost.  We have good score for both precision and recall. Our model for performs well.
